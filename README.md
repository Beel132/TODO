# TODO list (2020)

it's a normal TODO list, you can add and remove items.

**There's a clean and normal design, a great UX**

At first, you need to specify a thing _to do_, like the example above.

Then, when you hit the **enter key**, it automatically creates a new reminder
> **for example**

And, when you've already done, you can just click on the reminder itself, and it turns dark

And if you want to, you can just click the `X` button, and it disappears.
